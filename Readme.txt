Please acknowledge my work and not steal it and class it as your own, yes it may look very simple but it took me 
2 days to figure out how to lua code since I am very new to all GLua.

Installation Instructions:

Copy mf_hud_v1 into addons/darkrpmodification/lua/darkrp_modules

Copy resources into the base directory and merge with the resources folder already there.

You will also have to upload the resources folder to some type of FastDownload server so your 
clients can have the custom font.

*Note that at this time Hunger Mod has not yet been implimented correctly, it can be turned on but I have not yet
placed it in the right location.
